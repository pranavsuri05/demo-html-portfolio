<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m currently a BTech Computer Science student with a passion for blending technology and creativity. My journey in tech began with a fascination for how things work under the hood, leading me to dive deep into coding, web development, and AI/ML. Alongside my studies, I’ve been exploring various technologies and building projects that challenge and excite me.</p>

<p>Beyond the code, I thrive on leadership and social interaction. As an active member and Marketing Head of the Rotaract Club, I’ve had the chance to hone my skills in event management and marketing, organizing events, and securing sponsorships. My experiences have shaped me into a problem-solver who loves to bring people together and make a tangible impact through collaborative efforts.</p>

<p>I also have a keen interest in sustainability and environmental impact, inspired by real-world experiences. One of my current projects involves creating a web application to quantify carbon footprints for Indian coal mines, aiming to contribute to the path toward carbon neutrality. This blend of technology and purpose is what drives me, and I’m excited to share this journey with you through my website.</p>
